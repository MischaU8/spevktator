title: Spevktator - OSINT analysis tool for VK
description_html: |-
  <p>Spevktator provides a combined live feed of <a href="/vk?sql=select+domain%2C+count%28*%29+as+post_nr+from+posts+group+by+domain+order+by+post_nr+desc">5 popular Russian news channels on VK</a>, along with translations,
  sentiment analysis and visualisation tools, all of which is accessible online, from anywhere.
  We currently have an archive of <a href="/vk/posts_mega_view">over 67,000 posts</a>, dating back to the beginning of February 2022.</p>

  <p>Originally, it was created to help research domestic Russian propaganda narratives, but can also act as a monitoring hub for VK media content,
  allowing researchers and journalists to stay up to date on disinformation, even as chaotic events unfold.</p>
  
  <p>Sofisticated researchers can run this tool locally, against their own targets of research and even perform their
  detailed analysis offline through the <a href="https://datasette.io/">Datasette SQL interface</a>.</p>

  <p>For more information on Spevktator and installation / usage instructions see the <a href="https://github.com/MischaU8/spevktator#readme">README on GitHub</a></>
